                <h1>Content models</h1>
                <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements.<b> Block level</b> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while inline level elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
                <p>In this example the <b>heading 1 and the paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
                <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning.
